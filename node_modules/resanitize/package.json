  "readme": "#  Resanitize - Regular expression-based HTML sanitizer and ad remover, geared toward RSS feed descriptions\n\nThis node.js module provides functions for removing unsafe parts and ads from\nHTML. I am using it for the &lt;description&gt; element of RSS feeds.\n\n## Installation\n\nnpm install resanitize\n\n## Usage\n\n```javascript\n\n    var resanitize = require('resanitize')\n      , html = '<div style=\"border: 400px solid pink;\">Headline</div>'\n      ;\n\n    resanitize(html); // => '<div>Headline</div>'\n```\n\n## Notes\n\nThis module's opinion of \"sanitized\" might not meet your security requirements.\nThe mere fact that it uses regular expressions should make this disclaimer\nunnecessary, but just to be clear: if you intend to display arbitrary user input\nthat includes HTML, you're going to want something more robust.\n\nAs of v0.3.0, we've added [node-validator's](//github.com/chriso/node-validator) XSS\nfilter. It's certainly an improvement, but still -- be careful. Any concerns\nabout XSS attacks should be directered to [node-validator's issue tracker](//github.com/chriso/node-validator/issues).\n\nNote that the `stripUnsafeTags` method will loop over the strip an arbitrary\nnumber of times (2) to try to strip maliciously nested html tags. After the\nmaximum number of iterations is reached, if the string still appears to contain\nany unsafe tags, it is deemed unsafe and set to an empty string. If this seems\nunexpected and/or is causing any problems, please raise an [issue](//github.com/danmactough/node-resanitize/issues).",
